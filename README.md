Drawing app for every babies.

Babies can draw colored lines using a pen device **WITHOUT ANY BUTTONS, ANY CONTROLS AND ANY WINDOWS** so that drawing is not interrupted by non-canvas operations.

Come on, let's draw!

## Cautions

- To end the app, press Alt+F4 keys. (There are no buttons on the canvas)

## Note

- To enable pressure detection, you must use a pen device made by WACOM, and install the latest supported WACOM drivers.
