## Operating Environment

- Windows 10/11 64bit

## Cautions

- To end the app, press Alt+F4 keys. (There are no buttons on the canvas)

## How to use

1. Install the app using the installer.
1. Launch the app.
1. Now draw!

When the pen tip moves onto the color palette on the right side of the screen, the pen color changes to that color.

At this time, the pen can be floating off the device.

## Note
